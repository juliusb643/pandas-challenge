Pandas Challenge 

In the Module 4 Challenge, the class was given data on student performance in a given district and asked to do a comprehensive breakdown of the data to identify potential pitfalls, trends, etc. These datasets were able to tell us a significant amount of actionable data once they were parsed. 
  
  Overall, I would say that this district is not the greatest district in terms of academic achievement. The percentage of students that pass both math and reading is only 65.2%. However, things get interesting when you account for different school types, sizes, and budgets. 

1)	The underlying numbers for the district are actually worse than the 65.2% overall passing rate would indicate. It is clear that the “District” schools are lagging behind: all five of the lowest scores for overall passing rate are “District” schools. To the contrary, the top five highest scores for overall passing rate are all “Charter” schools. This would be fascinating enough on it’s own, but it is extra interesting to see how far off the “District” schools are.
The lowest overall passing rate for the “Charter” schools is 89%. The highest overall passing rate for the “District” schools is 54.6%. When comparing the worst “Charter” school to the best “District” school, it is clear that there is no comparison. 

2)	Another trend that I noticed was the fact that the more that was spent per student, the lower the scores became. While the money and investment is there, one would only need to look at the Spending Summary DataFrame in this code to see that the money spent per student isn’t translating to results. A sub-conclusion that you can draw from this is that the money is being allocated inefficiently. Where more dollars are being allocated, the results should be showing up. 

3)	By looking at the Size Summary DataFrame and the Type Summary DataFrame, there are many more facts that can be drawn. Scores drop off drastically when you sort the data by school size! Small and medium sized schools are very close in their numbers, but the larger schools are shockingly bad at almost every measurable category. Similarly, the Type Summary DataFrame shows us that the “Charter” schools mop the floor with the “District” schools in every way, outperforming them in all categories. 
	
 In conclusion, I would state that while the per student budget and size of the school plays a role, the type of school your child attends in the district is what will make or break their experience and education. 
To complete this assignment, I used the sample solution “PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb” to make sure that I was formatting everything properly. I also used the provided code on BootCampSpot. In terms of external resources, I took advantage of every avenue that was available. I was able to speak with my professor Reed Hyde, collaborate with my classmates Kiet, Victoria, Mia, and Michael,  get tutored by Reza Abasaltian, and used AI-powered resources such as Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT. I also reviewed previous files that we have worked on, to see if there was any insight I could glean from class.
